you plough into me with two fingers and i am mostly
shocked. it feels like rubber against an open wound. i do not
like it. you begin pushing faster and faster. but i feel nothing.
you search my face for a reaction so i begin acting like the
naked women in the videos you watch when you think no
one’s looking. i imitate their moans. hollow and hungry. you
ask if it feels good and i say yes so quickly it sounds
rehearsed. but the acting. you do not notice.
