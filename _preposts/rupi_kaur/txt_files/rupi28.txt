father. you always call to say nothing in particular. you ask
what i’m doing or where i am and when the silence stretches
like a lifetime between us i scramble to find questions to keep
the conversation going. what i long to say most is. i
understand this world broke you. it has been so hard on your
feet. i don’t blame you for not knowing how to remain soft
with me. sometimes i stay up thinking of all the places you
are hurting which you’ll never care to mention. i come from
the same aching blood. from the same bone so desperate for
attention i collapse in on myself. i am your daughter. i know
the small talk is the only way you know how to tell me you
love me. cause it is the only way i know how to tell you.
