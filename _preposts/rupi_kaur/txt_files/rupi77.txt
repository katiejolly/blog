the woman who comes after me will be a bootleg version of
who i am. she will try and write poems for you to erase the
ones i’ve left memorized on your lips but her lines could
never punch you in the stomach the way mine did. she will
then try to make love to your body. but she will never lick,
caress, or suck like me. she will be a sad replacement of the
woman you let slip. nothing she does will excite you and this
will break her. when she is tired of falling apart for a man that
doesn’t give back what he takes she will recognize me in your
eyelids staring at her with pity and it’ll hit her. how can she
love a man who is busy loving someone he can never get his
hands on again.
