past. one second. they swallow you up and whisper they
want to spend the rest of their life with you. but the moment
they sense fear. they are already halfway out the door.
without having the nerve to let you go with grace. as if the
human heart means that little to them.

and after all this. after all of the taking. the nerve. isn’t it sad
and funny how people have more guts these days to undress
you with their fingers than they do to pick up the phone and
call. apologize. for the loss. and this is how you lose her.
