you were the most beautiful thing i’d ever felt till now. and i
was convinced you’d remain the most beautiful thing i’d ever
feel. do you know how limiting that is. to think at such a ripe
young age i’d experienced the most exhilarating person i’d
ever meet. how i’d spend the rest of my life just settling. to
think i’d tasted the rawest form of honey and everything else
would be refined and synthetic. that nothing beyond this
point would add up. that all the years beyond me could not
combine themselves to be sweeter than you.
