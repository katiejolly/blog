what i miss most is how you loved me. but what i didn’t
know was how you loved me had so much to do with the
person i was. it was a reflection of everything i gave to you.
coming back to me. how did i not see that. how. did i sit here
soaking in the idea that no one else would love me that way.
when it was i that taught you. when it was i that showed you
how to fill. the way i needed to be filled. how cruel i was to
myself. giving you credit for my warmth simply because you
had felt it. thinking it was you who gave me strength. wit.
beauty. simply because you recognized it. as if i was already
not these things before i met you. as if i did not remain all
these once you left.
