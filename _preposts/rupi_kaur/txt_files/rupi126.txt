i am confident i am over you. so much that some mornings i
wake up with a smile on my face and my hands pressed
together thanking the universe for pulling you out of me.
thank god i cry. thank god you left. i would not be the empire
i am today if you had stayed.

but then.

there are some nights i imagine what i might do if you showed
up. how if you walked into the room this very second every
awful thing you’ve ever done would be tossed out the closest
window and all the love would rise up again. it would pour
through my eyes as if it never really left in the first place. as if
it’s been practicing how to stay silent so long only so it could
be this loud on your arrival. can someone explain that. how
even when the love leaves. it doesn’t leave. how even when i
am so past you. i am so helplessly brought back to you.
