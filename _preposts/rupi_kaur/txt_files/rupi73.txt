you said. if it is meant to be. fate will bring us back together.
for a second i wonder if you are really that naive. if you really
believe fate works like that. as if it lives in the sky staring
down at us. as if it has five fingers and spends its time placing
us like pieces of chess. as if it is not the choices we make.
who taught you that. tell me. who convinced you. you’ve
been given a heart and a mind that isn’t yours to use. that
your actions do not define what will become of you. i want to
scream and shout it’s us you fool. we’re the only ones that can
bring us back together. but instead i sit quietly. smiling softly
through quivering lips thinking. isn’t it such a tragic thing.
when you can see it so clearly but the other person doesn’t.
