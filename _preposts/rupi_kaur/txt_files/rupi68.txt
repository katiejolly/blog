don’t open it.

instead. lie me down. lay me open like a map. and with your
finger trace the places you still want to **** out of me. kiss
me like i am the center point of gravity and you are falling into
me like my soul is the focal point of yours. and when your
mouth is kissing not my mouth but other places. my legs will
split apart out of habit. and that’s when. i pull you in.
welcome you. home.

when the entire street is looking out their windows wondering
what all the commotion is. and the fire trucks come rolling in
to save us but they can’t distinguish whether these flames
began with our anger or our passion. i will smile. throw my
head back. arch my body like a mountain you want to split in
half. baby lick me.

like your mouth has the gift of reading and i’m your favorite
book. find your favorite page in the soft spot between my
legs and read it carefully. fluently. vividly. don’t you dare
leave a single word untouched. and i swear my ending will be
so good. the last few words will come. running to your mouth.
and when you’re done. take a seat. cause it’s my turn to make
music with my knees pressed to the ground.

sweet baby. this. is how we pull language out of one another
with the flick of our tongues. this is how we have the
conversation. this. is how we make up.


- how we make up
