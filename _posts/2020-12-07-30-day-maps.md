I recently designed a few maps during the [30 day map
challenge](https://github.com/katiejolly/30-day-maps-2020). Each day
during November has a different prompt and then cartographers across the
world can post maps to fit each of those themes. I got a few questions
about how I approach map design– particularly when designing things
quickly. I wanted to talk through my process in depth for one of the
maps that I made, [Okay, but, what is a suburb?]().

# Brainstorming

This map was designing for the “population” theme. I had designing a few
maps that were more for aesthetics, but I wanted this one to tell some
sort of story. One of my goals throughout the challenge was to practice
using data visualization as a narrative tool. I wanted people to walk
away from my maps with more questions and maybe some answers. To do
this, I first thought about what questions I have (or have heard) about
population.

One question I find myself thinking about a lot is how we classify
neighborhoods and the people who live within them. These classifications
can take many forms, but the discussion about what is
urban/suburban/rural is particularly interesting to me. Like many
residential planning questions this classification highly depends on
where you’re drawing the boundaries. Are you looking at counties?
Municipal boundaries? Zip codes? Census tracts?

The second idea I had was to look at [IRS county migration
data](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-migration-data). I
wasn’t sure what exactly I was going to look for, but one thought was to
look at counties that swung in major elections and looking to see where
their most common within-US migrants came from. I had used this dataset
previously to compare migration to Grand Rapids, MI and Detroit, MI and
wanted to do something similar.

With only one day (and really just a few hours after work) to make the
map, it’s important to narrow it down quickly and look at something
**specific**. I found that brainstorming was often the part that took
90% of my time when I tried to find the *perfect* topic instead of just
running with an idea. This is something I struggle with constantly. I
decided to go with the rural/suburban/urban idea in the end but not for
any specific reason.

# Finding data

Over the last few years I’ve tried to make the data-finding process
easier for myself. There’s no one way to do this, but I’ve learned a few
good tips. The one that has been the most useful for me has been
bookmarking articles, tweets, or anything else that mentions an
interesting dataset. I also like to bookmark the data itself, but having
the context from the article is key to figuring out quickly what the
data might be able to tell you.

This past summer I read an article in CityLab by David Montgomery called
[How to Tell If You Live in the
Suburbs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-07/how-to-define-american-suburbs)
(that I then quickly bookmarked\!). He notes the fact that the majority
of Americans say they live in a suburb “despite the category having no
formal definition.” Suburbs are historically thought of as “allegedly
white, middle class and socially homogenous” but that conception is
outdated; today’s suburbs are remarkably diverse.

Montgomery spends most of the article discussing a [dataset from
researchers at The Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Indeed.com,
and The U.S. Census
Bureau](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/AHS-neighborhood-description-study-2017.html#overview-tab).
The researchers surveyed 55,000 households asking “how would you
classify your neighborhood” and then used that labeled data to model
what demographic variables could best predict the neighborhood
classification.

From Montgomery’s article:

> Unsurprisingly, many people defined their neighborhoods in part by
> their population density. But a whole host of other factors also made
> the prediction more accurate. For example, areas with higher median
> incomes were more likely to be called suburban. Areas with older homes
> were more likely to be called urban. Areas with lots of senior
> citizens were more frequently called rural.

One fascinating case study is Pheonix, which just within the metro
boundaries has a mix of urban, suburban, *and
rural*.

The data itself includes a classification for each census tract in the
U.S. as well as the raw % of how many people would classify their
neighborhood as rural/suburban/urban. The researchers note that you
should use the raw % with caution and encourage people to use their
cleaned classification instead.

# Creating the map

When designing any data visualization there are a few key things to keep
in mind: who is your audience?, how is your audience viewing your work?,
and what do you want them to learn from it?.

  - Who is your audience?

I know that my audience will primarily be my followers on Twitter–
typically data savvy and many are interested in
planning/demographic/political topics. That means they’ll likely
understand what a census tract is, for example.

  - How is your audience viewing your work?

I was sharing all of my maps via [my Twitter
account](https://www.twitter.com/katiejolly6) so I tried hard to make
each of them 1024px x 512px (the recommended image size for images in
posts on Twitter). This means that the space available will be maximized
and the image will look the best it can in that format.

  - What do you want them to learn from it?

I want to use a representative state to highlight typical patterns in
residential developments. I also want to introduce people to this really
cool dataset and show them some of the things it can do.

I decided to focus on Virginia because (a) it’s a state I’m very
familiar with which helps when working quickly, (b) it has a lot of
variation between very rural and very urban areas, (c) it’s a state that
most people know at least a few things about but is small enough to
actually see the map on a phone screen on Twitter (no California or
Texas, for example), and (d) it’s wider than it is tall so it looks good
on a 1024px x 512px layout.

Enough thinking about the map, time to actually make it.

``` r
library(tidyverse) # data wrangling
library(tigris) # census boundaries
library(sf) # spatial data analysis
library(usethis) # downloading the data
library(ggnewscale) # more than one variable mapped to the fill aesthetic
```

You can download [the
data](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/AHS-neighborhood-description-study-2017.html#overview-tab)
with this link or directly from the website. This code will unzip the
file into the `destdir`. Only run this code once (you only need to
download the data once). I run this code in my console rather than
putting it in an
RMarkdown.

``` r
use_zip("https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/zip/UPSAI_050820.zip", destdir "20-population")
```

Then you can read in the csv from the unzipped folder you just
downloaded.

``` r
ahs_survey_2017 <- read_csv("20-population/UPSAI_050820/UPSAI_050820.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() # I also like to clean up the column names

knitr::kable(head(ahs_survey_2017))
```

I then downloaded the boundaries for Virginia tracts and counties using
`tigris` which pulls from the Census Tiger Line Files.

``` r
virginia_tracts <- tracts(state = "Virginia") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  st_transform(26917) # use the UTM 17M projection

virginia_counties <- counties(state = "Virginia") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  st_transform(26917)
```

Then I pulled out just the Virginia data and cleaned up the
classifications.

``` r
virginia_tracts_class <- virginia_tracts %>%
  select(geoid, countyfp) %>%
  left_join(ahs_survey_2017) %>%
  mutate(upsai_cat_clean = case_when(
    acs17_occupied_housing_units_est == 0 ~ NA_real_, # I don't want to include places with 0 households, a personal choice
    TRUE ~ upsai_cat_controlled
    ),
         upsai_cat_desc = case_when(
           upsai_cat_clean == 1 ~ "Urban", # add labels
           upsai_cat_clean == 2 ~ "Suburban",
           upsai_cat_clean == 3 ~ "Rural",
           is.na(upsai_cat_clean) ~ "No occupied housing",
           TRUE ~ NA_character_
         ),
    urban_cat = cut(x = upsai_urban, breaks = c(0, .6, .85, 1)), # categorizations for map colors
    suburban_cat = cut(x = upsai_suburban, breaks = c(0, .6, .85, 1)),
    rural_cat = cut(x = upsai_rural, breaks = c(0, .6, .85, 1)))
```

Now that the data is clean I can make the main state map. I first
thought about just mapping the three cleaned categories but I thought
there was useful data encoded in the %s as well. I wanted to use that to
show “transition zones” between classifications. But since those are raw
data, I wanted the overwhelming narrative (color) to be showing the
cleaned classifications with a less distinctive use of shade to denote
the degree of confidence.

By default `ggplot2` does not allow more than one variable to be mapped
to one aesthetic but in this case I want to map 3 variables
(`urban_cat`, `suburban_cat`, and `rural_cat`) to `fill`, each with
their own color scheme. The `ggnewscale` package is a really helpful way
to accomplish this and that’s what I’ve used here.

``` r
# set the color schemes
reds <- c("#733D47", "#BE7D88", "#D2A8AF")
greens <- c("#959E4A", "#C2CA8C", "#D7DDB4")
blues <- c("#0091C1", "#71B4D7", "#9ECBE5")


detail_map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = virginia_tracts_class %>%
            filter(upsai_cat_desc == "Urban"), aes(fill = urban_cat), lwd = 0.02, color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) + # add urban data to the map
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(reds)) +
  new_scale_fill() + # reset the fill scale
  geom_sf(data = virginia_tracts_class %>%
            filter(upsai_cat_desc == "Suburban"), aes(fill = suburban_cat), lwd = 0.02, color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) + # add surburban
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(blues)) +
  new_scale_fill() + # reset the fill scale
  geom_sf(data = virginia_tracts_class %>%
            filter(upsai_cat_desc == "Rural"), aes(fill = rural_cat), lwd = 0.02, color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(greens)) +
  geom_sf(data = virginia_counties, color = "gray10", lwd = 0.05, fill = NA) + # add county boundaries to help people orient themselves
  theme_void()

detail_map
```

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/water-lines/draw_main_map-1.png)

``` r
# save to the directory with specific dimensions

# ggsave("20-population/detailed_map.png", detail_map, dpi = 300, width = 12, height = 9)
```

# Designing the layout

**The layout was designed in Illustrator, only the maps were made with
R. Inkscape is a great free alternative to Illustrator\!**

At this point this was the only map I was going to include. I was
planning to just use text annotations to highlight particular metro
areas. I saw that there was quite a bit of empty space in the layout and
that some of the metros were hard to see so I decided to use insets
instead.

## Insets

I decided to use the D.C. area (major metro area), Richmond area
(Virginia’s largest city), and the Roanoke area (an isolated urban hub
in otherwise rural southwestern Virginia).

For each of these cities I found counties considered to be in the metro
area \> cropped the tracts using a bounding box \> made the
map.

``` r
dc_counties <- virginia_tracts_class[virginia_tracts_class$countyfp %in% c("510", "600", "610", "153", "107", "059", "013", "683", "685"), ]

dc_inset <- st_crop(virginia_tracts_class, st_bbox(dc_counties))

dc_map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = dc_inset %>%
            filter(upsai_cat_desc == "Urban"), aes(fill = urban_cat), lwd = 0.08, color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(reds)) +
  new_scale_fill() +
  geom_sf(data = dc_inset %>%
            filter(upsai_cat_desc == "Suburban"), aes(fill = suburban_cat), lwd = 0.08, color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(blues)) +
  new_scale_fill() +
  geom_sf(data = dc_inset %>%
            filter(upsai_cat_desc == "Rural"), aes(fill = rural_cat), lwd = 0.08, color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(greens)) +
  geom_sf(data = dc_counties, color = "gray10", lwd = 0.2, fill = NA) +
  theme_void()

dc_map
```

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/water-lines/dc-1.png)

``` r
# ggsave("20-population/dc_map.png", dc_map, dpi = 300, width = 5, height = 5)
```

``` r
richmond_counties <- virginia_tracts_class[virginia_tracts_class$countyfp %in% c("041", "087", "085", "760"), ]

richmond_inset <- st_crop(virginia_tracts_class, st_bbox(richmond_counties))

richmond_map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = richmond_inset %>%
            filter(upsai_cat_desc == "Urban"), aes(fill = urban_cat), lwd = 0.08, color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(reds)) +
  new_scale_fill() +
  geom_sf(data = richmond_inset %>%
            filter(upsai_cat_desc == "Suburban"), aes(fill = suburban_cat), lwd = 0.08, color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) +

  geom_sf(data = richmond_counties, color = "gray10", lwd = 0.2, fill = NA) +

```

``` r
# ggsave("20-population/richmond_map.png", richmond_map, dpi = 300, width = 5, height = 5)
```

``` r
roanoke_counties <- virginia_tracts_class[virginia_tracts_class$countyfp %in% c("023", "045", "067", "161", "770", "775"), ]

roanoke_inset <- st_crop(virginia_tracts_class, st_bbox(roanoke_counties))

roanoke_map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = roanoke_inset %>%
            filter(upsai_cat_desc == "Urban"), aes(fill = urban_cat), lwd = 0.08, color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(reds)) +
  new_scale_fill() +
  geom_sf(data = roanoke_inset %>%
            filter(upsai_cat_desc == "Suburban"), aes(fill = suburban_cat), lwd = 0.08, color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(blues)) +
  new_scale_fill() +
  geom_sf(data = roanoke_inset %>%
            filter(upsai_cat_desc == "Rural"), aes(fill = rural_cat), lwd = 0.08, color = "white", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(greens)) +
  geom_sf(data = roanoke_counties, color = "gray10", lwd = 0.2, fill = NA) +
  theme_void()

roanoke_map
```

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/water-lines/roanoke-1.png)

``` r
# ggsave("20-population/roanoke_map.png", roanoke_map, dpi = 300, width = 5, height = 5)
```

I then pulled each of these maps into Illustrator and drew approximate
rectangles around where they were on the main map. I used labels instead
of arrows to mark each one.

## Legend

I wanted the legend to be more than just listing the categories so I
combined it with the subtitle. I used only 3 categories for each
classification because any more than that would make the legend too
complicated for a map that someone might quickly glance at while
scrolling and because the colors would get more difficult to
distinguish.

## Annotation

Annotation should always add to the narrative, not just add words to the
map. I.e. your users should learn something from the annotations that
they wouldn’t have otherwise seen/learned from your map. I used my
annotation space to describe the radial pattern around a metro area
(even though people could see this on their own, it’s a main point of
the map and worth reiterating to help guide people on how to read it)
and give some summary statistics about households.

# Pulling it all together

The last major design category here is typography (what fonts to use and
how to use them). I chose a simple sans serif font
([Ilisarniq](https://coppersandbrasses.com/typefaces/ilisarniq/)) for
the map text and a more interesting title font ([Big
John](https://www.dafontfree.io/big-john-slim-joe-font-free/)) to draw
attention to the map in the busy social media space. I used color with
the font to help people make quick associations based on the colors in
the map (for example making the title blue because the question is about
suburbs specifically).

I also always make sure to put credits (both to the data and to myself)
at the bottom so that people know where to check my work or get more
information\!

I hope this post is useful for learning about how I think about data
visualization. I’ve learned a lot of these tips over the years from
reading other blog posts and articles as well and it’s taken lots of
practice to put it all together\! Feel free to leave a comment or reach
out on twitter if you have more questions for me\!
